          "Welcome to a kingdom of animals, real, ancient and imagined: a
          kingdom ruled by lions, dinosaurs and dragons; a kingdom of balance,

          April 22, 1998 Walt Disney World's fourth and newest theme park opened
          in April 1998, joining the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney-MGM
          Studios. When it opened, park advertising used the faux-African word
          "nahtazu" ("not a zoo") as a slogan to emphasize that it was not just
          a collection of animals in small iron cages. The animals here spend
          their days in expansive habitats that are as close to their natural
          environments as possible, with subtle and camouflaged barriers keeping
          them away from guests (and each other). At night, they sleep
          comfortably indoors in the park's extensive housing area backstage.
          Although the animals are nominally the main attraction, the park has
          slowly expanded its ride offerings, allowing the park to stay open
          later after the animals are put to bed. The marquee attraction from
          that perspective is the wild roller coaster, Expedition Everest.
          Towering 200 feet over the surrounding terrain, this mini-mountain is
          visible
